    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>
      Hi, I’m Ankit Sharma, and I’m currently an AP Analyst at Genpact in
      Budapest. I hold a Master’s degree in Applied Mathematics and have over
      four years of experience in web development and data analysis. My
      professional journey includes building scalable web applications with
      ReactJS and Redux, as well as automating workflows and creating insightful
      dashboards using SQL and Power BI. What drives me is solving complex
      problems and collaborating with cross-functional teams to deliver
      high-impact solutions. I’m particularly excited about the opportunity at
      Sportsbook because of its innovative environment, focus on
      high-performance platforms, and the chance to contribute to a product used
      by millions globally.

    <h2>Real-Time project</h2>
    <h3>E-ship</h3>
    <p>
      At E-ship Simplified, I worked on a logistics platform designed to
      optimize the shipping process for small to medium-sized businesses. My key
      contribution was improving the app's scalability by leveraging Redux for
      state management. For example, the platform needed to handle dynamic
      shipment data updates, and the previous implementation struggled under
      load. I refactored the state management to Redux, reducing API calls by
      caching frequently accessed data, which significantly improved
      performance. Additionally, I enhanced the user experience using React
      Router by enabling smooth navigation between different views, such as
      shipment tracking, invoicing, and customer support. This ensured seamless
      transitions and made the platform more intuitive, especially for users
      unfamiliar with tech-heavy interfaces.
    </p>
    <h3>Dreammill</h3>
    <p>
      At Dreammill, I was part of a team developing an e-learning platform for
      schools and individual learners. My role was focused on creating an
      interactive single-page application (SPA) using ReactJS. One of my major
      achievements was implementing responsive design for the course catalog and
      student progress dashboard. I worked closely with the UI/UX team to ensure
      the platform was accessible across various devices, from smartphones to
      desktops. I also implemented DOM manipulation techniques for real-time
      updates, such as progress tracking and live quizzes. This significantly
      increased user engagement by making the platform visually appealing and
      functionally seamless.
    </p>
    <h2>Motivation</h2>
    <h3>Why do you want to join Sportsbook?</h3>
    <p>
      I am drawn to Sportsbook because it offers the unique opportunity to work
      on a cutting-edge, high-performance betting platform. The idea of
      contributing to a product that serves millions of users globally excites
      me, particularly the challenge of ensuring a seamless user experience
      under high traffic. Sportsbook’s in-house platform and emphasis on
      innovation align perfectly with my passion for building scalable,
      user-focused applications.
    </p>
    <h3>
      What excites you about working on a high-performance betting platform?
    </h3>
    <p>
      The scale and complexity of a high-performance betting platform excite me.
      Handling real-time data for thousands of events and ensuring a flawless
      user experience under heavy load requires innovative solutions. I am
      particularly motivated by the opportunity to collaborate with
      cross-functional teams and leverage modern frameworks like Angular and
      RxJS to deliver a world-class product.
    </p>
    <h2>Technical</h2>
    <h3>Describe your experience with Angular, RxJS, or ngRx.</h3>
    <p>
      Although my primary experience is with React and Redux, I am familiar with
      the concepts of Angular and RxJS. Redux and ngRx share similar principles
      of state management, and I have successfully implemented these patterns in
      past projects to optimize performance. I am confident that my ability to
      quickly learn and adapt to new technologies will allow me to excel with
      Angular and RxJS as well.
    </p>
    <h3>How do you approach implementing responsive design?</h3>
    <p>
      I follow a mobile-first approach, ensuring the application is optimized
      for smaller devices before scaling up to larger screens. I use CSS media
      queries and frameworks like Bootstrap or Material-UI to achieve
      consistency across different resolutions. I also collaborate closely with
      UI/UX designers to ensure the design meets user expectations while
      maintaining accessibility standards.
    </p>
    <h2>Soft skills</h2>
    <h3>Example of solving a complex problem in a cross-functional team:</h3>
    <p>
      While at Genpact, I collaborated with the IT and finance teams to automate
      a complex reporting process. Initially, there was confusion about the data
      flow and requirements. I organized a workshop to clarify each team’s needs
      and mapped out a unified workflow. By creating a SQL-based automation
      script and integrating it with Power BI dashboards, we reduced the
      reporting time by 30% while ensuring accuracy. This experience taught me
      the value of effective communication and cross-functional collaboration
    </p>
    <h2>Adaptability</h2>
    <h3>Handling high traffic in a frontend application:</h3>
    <p>
      To ensure scalability for high-traffic applications like Sportsbook, I
      would implement lazy loading and code splitting to optimize resource
      usage. Additionally, I would use caching strategies, such as service
      workers, to minimize server requests. Monitoring tools like Lighthouse and
      New Relic would help identify bottlenecks and optimize performance.
    </p>
    <h2>To Impress</h2>
    <h3>Deep Understanding:</h3>
    <p>
      Sportsbook serves as a hub for millions of users globally. To improve the
      UX during high-traffic days, I propose features like a load-aware
      interface that prioritizes essential functionalities, such as bet
      placement, while deferring non-critical features. Additionally, predictive
      caching could be implemented to pre-fetch popular events, ensuring a
      smooth experience even during peak times
    </p>
    <h3>Team Fit:</h3>
    <p>
      Throughout my career, I’ve worked in agile, cross-functional teams,
      collaborating with developers, designers, and data analysts. This has
      prepared me to contribute effectively to a team like Sportsbook, where
      collaboration and communication are key to delivering high-performance
      products.
    </p>
    <h3>Passion for Innovation:</h3>
    <p>
      My continuous learning journey—from completing advanced courses in
      JavaScript and Python to gaining hands-on experience with Power BI and
      SQL—demonstrates my passion for staying ahead in the tech industry. I am
      excited to bring this mindset to Sportsbook and contribute to its
      innovative solutions.
    </p>
    <h2>Stand-Out Reasons</h2>
    <h3>Versatility:</h3>
    <p>
      I bring a unique combination of frontend development skills (ReactJS,
      JavaScript) and backend/data analysis expertise (SQL, Power BI). This
      versatility allows me to contribute effectively to both user-facing
      features and backend optimizations.
    </p>
    <h3>Proven Track Record:</h3>
    <p>
      I have successfully delivered scalable, user-friendly applications in
      previous roles, such as the logistics platform at E-ship Simplified and
      the e-learning platform at Dreammill
    </p>
    <h3>Cultural Fit and Passion</h3>
    <p>
      I thrive in dynamic, collaborative environments and am passionate about
      building innovative solutions. My ability to adapt quickly and learn new
      technologies makes me a strong fit for the high-performance culture at
      Sportsbook.
