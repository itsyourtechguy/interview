    </p>

    <h2>Interview Questions and Answers</h2>
    <h3>1. Can you tell me more about your background and how it aligns with this role?</h3>
    <p>
      In my previous roles,
      I've built scalable web applications using ReactJS and Redux, focusing on
      creating reusable components and optimizing development workflows. For
      instance, at E-ship Simplified, I enhanced the platform's scalability by
      implementing Redux for state management, which improved performance and
      user experience. While my primary experience is with React, I am eager to
      leverage my strong foundation in JavaScript to transition into working
      with Angular and RxJS, as used in your tech stack.
    </p>

    <h3>2. What motivates you to join Betsson Group's Sportsbook team?</h3>
    <p>
      I'm excited about the opportunity to work on a high-performance betting
      platform that serves a global audience. The challenge of ensuring a
      seamless user experience under high traffic aligns with my passion for
      building scalable, user-focused applications. Betsson Group's commitment
      to innovation and its collaborative work environment are aspects I highly
      value. Moreover, the Budapest office's dynamic and creative workspace, as
      highlighted in your company profile, makes it an ideal place for
      professional growth.
    </p>

    <h3>3. How do you approach learning new technologies, such as transitioning from React to Angular?</h3>
    <p>
      I believe in a proactive and structured approach to learning. I start by understanding
      its core concepts and differences from React. I utilize official
      documentation, online courses, and hands-on projects to reinforce my
      learning. I am confident that my strong foundation in JavaScript and
      experience with component-based frameworks will facilitate a smooth
      transition.
    </p>

    <h3>4. Can you describe a time when you worked in a cross-functional team and how you ensured effective collaboration?</h3>
    <p>
      At Dreammill, I was part of a team developing an e-learning platform that
      included designers, backend developers, and QA engineers. To ensure
      effective collaboration, we held regular meetings to align on goals and
      progress. I actively communicated with the UI/UX designers to implement
      responsive designs and coordinated with backend developers to integrate
      APIs seamlessly. This collaborative approach resulted in a cohesive
      product that met all stakeholder expectations.
    </p>

    <h3>5. What are your expectations for your professional development at Betsson Group?</h3>
    <p>
      I am looking forward to expanding my technical expertise, particularly in
      Angular and RxJS, and contributing to large-scale projects that have a
      significant impact. I also hope to engage in the various training and
      development programs offered, such as access to Pluralsight and Udemy
      accounts, as mentioned in your company benefits. Additionally, I am
      interested in participating in internal initiatives like the Coding Dojo
      and team-building activities to enhance my skills and integrate into the
      company culture.
    </p>

    <h3>6. How do you handle tight deadlines and manage priorities in a high-pressure environment?</h3>
    <p>
      I rely on a structured approach to handle tight deadlines. I prioritize tasks by their impact and deadlines, breaking them into manageable chunks. Communication is key—I ensure that stakeholders are updated on progress and any potential blockers. In one instance, while working on a logistics platform, I had overlapping deadlines for feature releases. By using Agile principles, collaborating effectively, and maintaining a clear focus, I delivered both on time without compromising quality.
    </p>

    <h3>7. How do you ensure your codebase remains maintainable and scalable?</h3>
    <p>
      I follow best practices such as writing clean and modular code, adhering to consistent coding standards, and implementing unit and integration tests. Additionally, I use version control systems effectively and conduct thorough code reviews. For scalability, I design components to be reusable and consider future requirements during development. This approach has helped me maintain high-quality codebases in collaborative environments.
    </p>

    <h3>8. Can you share an example of a technical challenge you faced and how you resolved it?</h3>
    <p>
      During the development of an e-commerce dashboard, I encountered performance issues due to excessive API calls. To resolve this, I implemented caching using Redux middleware and optimized API endpoints for batch requests. These changes reduced API traffic by 30% and significantly improved page load times, enhancing the user experience.
    </p>

    <h3>9. How do you approach accessibility in web development?</h3>
    <p>
      Accessibility is a priority in my development process. I use semantic HTML, ARIA roles, and ensure proper contrast ratios to make applications accessible to users with disabilities. I also test using tools like Lighthouse and screen readers to identify and address accessibility issues. My goal is to create inclusive applications that cater to diverse user needs.
    </p>

    <h3>10. Do you have any questions about the Sportsbook team or the Budapest office?</h3>
    <p>
      Yes, I do have a few questions:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Can you tell me more about the current projects the Sportsbook team is working on and how this role contributes to those initiatives?</li>
      <li>How does the team stay updated with industry trends and incorporate new technologies into the development process?</li>
      <li>What are the opportunities for career progression within the Sportsbook team and the broader Betsson Group?</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Real-Time Project</h2>
    <h3>E-ship</h3>
    <p>
      At E-ship Simplified, I worked on a logistics platform designed to
      optimize the shipping process for small to medium-sized businesses. My key
      contribution was improving the app's scalability by leveraging Redux for
      state management. For example, the platform needed to handle dynamic
      shipment data updates, and the previous implementation struggled under
      load. I refactored the state management to Redux, reducing API calls by
      caching frequently accessed data, which significantly improved
      performance. Additionally, I enhanced the user experience using React
      Router by enabling smooth navigation between different views, such as
      shipment tracking, invoicing, and customer support. This ensured seamless
      transitions and made the platform more intuitive, especially for users
      unfamiliar with tech-heavy interfaces.
    </p>

    <h3>Dreammill</h3>
    <p>
      At Dreammill, I was part of a team developing an e-learning platform for
      schools and individual learners. My role was focused on creating an
      interactive single-page application (SPA) using ReactJS. One of my major
      achievements was implementing responsive design for the course catalog and
      student progress dashboard. I worked closely with the UI/UX team to ensure
      the platform was accessible across various devices, from smartphones to
      desktops. I also implemented DOM manipulation techniques for real-time
      updates, such as progress tracking and live quizzes. This significantly
      increased user engagement by making the platform visually appealing and
      functionally seamless.
    </p>

    <h2>Technical</h2>
    <h3>Describe your experience with Angular, RxJS, or ngRx.</h3>
    <p>
      Although my primary experience is with React and Redux, I am familiar with
      the concepts of Angular and RxJS. Redux and ngRx share similar principles
      of state management, and I have successfully implemented these patterns in
      past projects to optimize performance. I am confident that my ability to
      quickly learn and adapt to new technologies will allow me to excel with
      Angular and RxJS as well.
    </p>

    <h3>How do you approach implementing responsive design?</h3>
    <p>
      I follow a mobile-first approach, ensuring the application is optimized
      for smaller devices before scaling up to larger screens. I use CSS media
      queries and frameworks like Bootstrap or Material-UI to achieve
      consistency across different resolutions. I also collaborate closely with
      UI/UX designers to ensure the design meets user expectations while
      maintaining accessibility standards.
    </p>
